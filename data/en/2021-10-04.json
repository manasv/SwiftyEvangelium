They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead.\n[[Lc 10,31]]A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.\n[[Lc 10,32]]Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.\n[[Lc 10,33]]But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.\n[[Lc 10,34]]He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn and cared for him.\n[[Lc 10,35]]The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction, 'Take care of him. If you spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.'\n[[Lc 10,36]]Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the robbers' victim?\"\n[[Lc 10,37]]He answered, \"The one who treated him with mercy.\" Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\"","title":"Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke","reference_displayed":"10,25-37.","type":"gospel"},"psalm":{"text":"[[Jon 2,2]]Out of my distress I called to the LORD,\n[[Jon 2,3]]and he answered me; \r\nFrom the midst of the nether world I cried for help, \r\nand you heard my voice.\n\n[[Jon 2,4]]For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the sea,\r\nand the flood enveloped me;\r\nAll your breakers and your billows\r\npassed over me.\n\n[[Jon 2,5]]Then I said, “I am banished from your sight!\r\nyet would I again look upon your holy temple.”\n[[Jon 2,8]]When my soul fainted within me,\r\nI remembered the LORD;\r\nMy prayer reached you\r\nin your holy temple.","title":"Book of Jonah","reference_displayed":"2,2.3.4.5.8.","type":"psalm"},"first_reading":{"text":"[[Jon 1,1]]This is the word of the LORD that came to Jonah, son of Amittai:\n[[Jon 1,2]]\"Set out for the great city of Nineveh, and preach against it; their wickedness has come up before me.\"\n[[Jon 1,3]]But Jonah made ready to flee to Tarshish away from the LORD.
