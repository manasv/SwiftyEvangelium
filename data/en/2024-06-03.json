So, too, many others; some they beat, others they killed.\n[[Mc 12,6]]He had one other to send, a beloved son. He sent him to them last of all, thinking, 'They will respect my son.'\n[[Mc 12,7]]But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'\n[[Mc 12,8]]So they seized him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.\n[[Mc 12,9]]What (then) will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come, put the tenants to death, and give the vineyard to others.\n[[Mc 12,10]]Have you not read this scripture passage: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;\n[[Mc 12,11]]by the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes'?\"\n[[Mc 12,12]]They were seeking to arrest him, but they feared the crowd, for they realized that he had addressed the parable to them.
