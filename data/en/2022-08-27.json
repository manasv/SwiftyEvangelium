Then he went away. Immediately\n[[Mt 25,16]]the one who received five talents went and traded with them, and made another five.\n[[Mt 25,17]]Likewise, the one who received two made another two.\n[[Mt 25,18]]But the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money.\n[[Mt 25,19]]After a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.\n[[Mt 25,20]]The one who had received five talents came forward bringing the additional five. He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five more.'\n[[Mt 25,21]]His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.'\n[[Mt 25,22]](Then) the one who had received two talents also came forward and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more.'\n[[Mt 25,23]]His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.'\n[[Mt 25,24]]Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you were a demanding person, harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter;\n[[Mt 25,25]]so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground. Here it is back.'\n[[Mt 25,26]]His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant and gather where I did not scatter?\n[[Mt 25,27]]Should you not then have put my money in the bank so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?\n[[Mt 25,28]]Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.\n[[Mt 25,29]]For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.\n[[Mt 25,30]]And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'”","reference_displayed":"25,14-30."},"psalm":{"type":"psalm","reference_displayed":"33(32),12-13.18-19.20-21.","text":"[[Ps 33,12]]Blessed the nation whose God is the LORD, \r\nthe people he has chosen for his own inheritance.\n[[Ps 33,13]]From heaven the LORD looks down; \r\nHe sees all mankind.\n\n[[Ps 33,18]]See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him, \r\nupon those who hope for his kindness,\n[[Ps 33,19]]To deliver them from death \r\nand preserve them in spite of famine.\n\n[[Ps 33,20]]Our soul waits for the LORD, \r\nwho is our help and our shield,\n[[Ps 33,21]]For in him our hearts rejoice; \r\nIn his holy name we trust.","title":"Psalms"},"first_reading":{"title":"First Letter to the Corinthians","type":"reading","text":"[[1_Co 1,26]]Consider your own calling, brothers.
