The king said to the girl, \"Ask of me whatever you wish and I will grant it to you.\"\n[[Mc 6,23]]He even swore (many things) to her, \"I will grant you whatever you ask of me, even to half of my kingdom.\"\n[[Mc 6,24]]She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?\" She replied, \"The head of John the Baptist.\"\n[[Mc 6,25]]The girl hurried back to the king's presence and made her request, \"I want you to give me at once on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\"\n[[Mc 6,26]]The king was deeply distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests he did not wish to break his word to her.\n[[Mc 6,27]]So he promptly dispatched an executioner with orders to bring back his head.

The girl in turn gave it to her mother.\n[[Mc 6,29]]When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.","type":"gospel","title":"Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark","reference_displayed":"6,17-29."},"psalm":{"text":"[[Ps 71,1]]In you, LORD, I take refuge; \r\nlet me never be put to shame.\n[[Ps 71,2]]In your justice rescue and deliver me; \r\nincline your ear to me, and save me.\n\n[[Ps 71,3]]Be my rock of refuge, \r\na stronghold to give me safety, \r\nfor you are my rock and my fortress.\n[[Ps 71,4a]]O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked.\n\n[[Ps 71,5]]For you are my hope, O Lord; \r\nmy trust, O God, from my youth.\n[[Ps 71,6a]]On you I depend from birth;\n[[Ps 71,6b]]from my mother's womb you are my strength.\n\n[[Ps 71,15a]]My mouth shall declare your justice,\n[[Ps 71,15b]]day by day your salvation.\n[[Ps 71,17]]O God, you have taught me from my youth, \r\nand till the present I proclaim your wondrous deeds.","type":"psalm","title":"Psalms","reference_displayed":"71(70),1-2.3-4a.5-6ab.15ab.17."},"date":"2023-08-29","first_reading":{"text":"[[Jr 1,17]]The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Gird your loins; stand up and tell them all that I command you.
