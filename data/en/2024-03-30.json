The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place behind them,\n[[Ex 14,20]]so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long.\n[[Ex 14,21]]Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD swept the sea with a strong east wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land. When the water was thus divided,\n[[Ex 14,22]]the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.\n[[Ex 14,23]]The Egyptians followed in pursuit; all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them right into the midst of the sea.\n[[Ex 14,24]]In the night watch just before dawn the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic;\n[[Ex 14,25]]and he so clogged their chariot wheels that they could hardly drive. With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel, because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians.\n[[Ex 14,26]]Then the LORD told Moses, \"Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and their charioteers.\"\n[[Ex 14,27]]So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea, when the LORD hurled them into its midst.\n[[Ex 14,28]]As the water flowed back, it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army which had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them escaped.\n[[Ex 14,29]]But the Israelites had marched on dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.\n[[Ex 14,30]]Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day from the power of the Egyptians.
