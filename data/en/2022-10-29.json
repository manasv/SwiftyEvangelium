A more distinguished guest than you may have been invited by him,\n[[Lc 14,9]]and the host who invited both of you may approach you and say, 'Give your place to this man,' and then you would proceed with embarrassment to take the lowest place.\n[[Lc 14,10]]Rather, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he may say, 'My friend, move up to a higher position.' Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table.\n[[Lc 14,11]]For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\""},"psalm":{"reference_displayed":"42(41),2.3.5cdef.","type":"psalm","title":"Psalms","text":"[[Ps 42,2]]As the hind longs for the running waters, \r\nso my soul longs for you, O God.\n[[Ps 42,3]]Athirst is my soul for God, the living God. \r\nWhen shall I go and behold the face of God?\n\n[[Ps 42,5c]]I went with the throng\n[[Ps 42,5d]]And led them in procession to the house of God.\n[[Ps 42,5e]]Amid loud cries of joy and thanksgiving,\n[[Ps 42,5f]]With the multitude keeping festival."},"first_reading":{"reference_displayed":"1,18b-26.","type":"reading","text":"[[Ph 1,18b]]Brothers and sisters: As long as in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed?
