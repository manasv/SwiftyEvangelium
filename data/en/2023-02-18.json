Through this he was attested to be righteous, God bearing witness to his gifts, and through this, though dead, he still speaks.\n[[He 11,5]]By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and \"he was found no more because God had taken him.\" Before he was taken up, he was attested to have pleased God.\n[[He 11,6]]But without faith it is impossible to please him, for anyone who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.\n[[He 11,7]]By faith Noah, warned about what was not yet seen, with reverence built an ark for the salvation of his household.
