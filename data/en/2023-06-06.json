I went to see some doctors for a cure, but the more they anointed my eyes with various salves, the worse the cataracts became, until I could see no more. For four years I was deprived of eyesight, and all my kinsmen were grieved at my condition. Ahiqar, however, took care of me for two years, until he left for Elymais.\n[[Tb 2,11]]At that time my wife Anna worked for hire at weaving cloth, the kind of work women do.\n[[Tb 2,12]]When she sent back the goods to their owners, they would pay her. Late in winter she finished the cloth and sent it back to the owners. They paid her the full salary, and also gave her a young goat for the table.\n[[Tb 2,13]]On entering my house the goat began to bleat. I called to my wife and said: \"Where did this goat come from? Perhaps it was stolen! Give it back to its owners; we have no right to eat stolen food!\"\n[[Tb 2,14]]But she said to me, \"It was given to me as a bonus over and above my wages.\" Yet I would not believe her, and told her to give it back to its owners. I became very angry with her over this. So she retorted: \"Where are your charitable deeds now? Where are your virtuous acts? See! Your true character is finally showing itself!\""},"gospel":{"reference_displayed":"12,13-17.","type":"gospel","title":"Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark","text":"[[Mc 12,13]]Some Pharisees and Herodians were sent to Jesus to ensnare him in his speech.\n[[Mc 12,14]]They came and said to him, \"Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you are not concerned with anyone's opinion. You do not regard a person's status but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?
