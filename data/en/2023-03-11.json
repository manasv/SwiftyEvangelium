So the father divided the property between them.\n[[Lc 15,13]]After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.\n[[Lc 15,14]]When he had freely spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he found himself in dire need.\n[[Lc 15,15]]So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.\n[[Lc 15,16]]And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed, but nobody gave him any.\n[[Lc 15,17]]Coming to his senses he thought, 'How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food to eat, but here am I, dying from hunger.\n[[Lc 15,18]]I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.\n[[Lc 15,19]]I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.\"'\n[[Lc 15,20]]So he got up and went back to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.\n[[Lc 15,21]]His son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.'\n[[Lc 15,22]]But his father ordered his servants, 'Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.\n[[Lc 15,23]]Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then let us celebrate with a feast,\n[[Lc 15,24]]because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been found.' Then the celebration began.\n[[Lc 15,25]]Now the older son had been out in the field and, on his way back, as he neared the house, he heard the sound of music and dancing.\n[[Lc 15,26]]He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.\n[[Lc 15,27]]The servant said to him, 'Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'\n[[Lc 15,28]]He became angry, and when he refused to enter the house, his father came out and pleaded with him.\n[[Lc 15,29]]He said to his father in reply, 'Look, all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.\n[[Lc 15,30]]But when your son returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes, for him you slaughter the fattened calf.'\n[[Lc 15,31]]He said to him, 'My son, you are here with me always; everything I have is yours.\n[[Lc 15,32]]But now we must celebrate and rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.'\""},"first_reading":{"title":"Book of Micah","type":"reading","reference_displayed":"7,14-15.18-20.","text":"[[Mi 7,14]]Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, That dwells apart in a woodland, in the midst of Carmel.
