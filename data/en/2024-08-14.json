They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.\n[[Ez 9,3]]Then he called to the man dressed in linen with the writer's case at his waist,\n[[Ez 9,4]]saying to him: Pass through the city (through Jerusalem) and mark an X on the foreheads of those who moan and groan over all the abominations that are practiced within it.\n[[Ez 9,5]]To the others I heard him say: Pass through the city after him and strike! Do not look on them with pity nor show any mercy!\n[[Ez 9,6]]Old men, youths and maidens, women and children--wipe them out! But do not touch any marked with the X; begin at my sanctuary. So they began with the men (the elders) who were in front of the temple.\n[[Ez 9,7]]Defile the temple, he said to them, and fill the courts with the slain; then go out and strike in the city.\n[[Ez 10,18]]Then the glory of the LORD left the threshold of the temple and rested upon the cherubim.\n[[Ez 10,19]]These lifted their wings, and I saw them rise from the earth, the wheels rising along with them.
