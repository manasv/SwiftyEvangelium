Or do you show contempt for the church of God and make those who have nothing feel ashamed? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this matter I do not praise you.\n[[1_Co 11,23]]For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was handed over, took bread,\n[[1_Co 11,24]]and, after he had given thanks, broke it and said, \"This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\"\n[[1_Co 11,25]]In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"\n[[1_Co 11,26]]For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.\n[[1_Co 11,33]]Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.","title":"First Letter to the Corinthians","type":"reading"},"date":"2024-09-16","psalm":{"reference_displayed":"40(39),7-8a.8b-9.10.17.","title":"Psalms","text":"[[Ps 40,7]]Sacrifice or oblation you wished not, \r\nbut ears open to obedience you gave me. \r\nBurnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;\n[[Ps 40,8a]]then said I, “Behold I come.”\n\n[[Ps 40,8b]]“In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,\n[[Ps 40,9]]To do your will, O my God, is my delight, \r\nand your law is within my heart!”\n\n[[Ps 40,10]]I announced your justice in the vast assembly; \r\nI did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.\n\n[[Ps 40,17]]May all who seek you \r\nexult and be glad in you, \r\nand may those who love your salvation \r\nsay ever, “The LORD be glorified.”","type":"psalm"},"gospel":{"text":"[[Lc 7,1]]When Jesus had finished all his words to the people, he entered Capernaum.\n[[Lc 7,2]]A centurion there had a slave who was ill and about to die, and he was valuable to him.\n[[Lc 7,3]]When he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and save the life of his slave.\n[[Lc 7,4]]They approached Jesus and strongly urged him to come, saying, \"He deserves to have you do this for him,\n[[Lc 7,5]]for he loves our nation and he built the synagogue for us.\"\n[[Lc 7,6]]And Jesus went with them, but when he was only a short distance from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, \"Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof.\n[[Lc 7,7]]Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but say the word and let my servant be healed.\n[[Lc 7,8]]For I too am a person subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me.
