He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, \"Get up quickly.\" The chains fell from his wrists.\n[[Ac 12,8]]The angel said to him, \"Put on your belt and your sandals.\" He did so. Then he said to him, \"Put on your cloak and follow me.\"\n[[Ac 12,9]]So he followed him out, not realizing that what was happening through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.\n[[Ac 12,10]]They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate leading out to the city, which opened for them by itself. They emerged and made their way down an alley, and suddenly the angel left him.\n[[Ac 12,11]]Then Peter recovered his senses and said, \"Now I know for certain that (the) Lord sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people had been expecting.\""},"psalm":{"type":"psalm","reference_displayed":"34(33),2-3.4-5.6-7.8-9.","title":"Psalms","text":"[[Ps 34,2]]I will bless the LORD at all times; \r\nhis praise shall be ever in my mouth.\n[[Ps 34,3]]Let my soul glory in the LORD; \r\nthe lowly will hear me and be glad.\n\n[[Ps 34,4]]Glorify the LORD with me, \r\nlet us together extol his name.\n[[Ps 34,5]]I sought the LORD, and he answered me \r\nand delivered me from all my fears.\n\n[[Ps 34,6]]Look to him that you may be radiant with joy, \r\nand your faces may not blush with shame.\n[[Ps 34,7]]When the poor one called out, the LORD heard, \r\nand from all his distress he saved him.\n\n[[Ps 34,8]]The angel of the LORD encamps \r\naround those who fear him, and delivers them.\n[[Ps 34,9]]Taste and see how good the LORD is; \r\nblessed the man who takes refuge in him."},"second_reading":{"type":"reading","reference_displayed":"4,6-8.17-18.","title":"Second Letter to Timothy","text":"[[2_Tm 4,6]]Beloved: I am already being poured out like a libation, and the time of my departure is at hand.\n[[2_Tm 4,7]]I have competed well; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith.\n[[2_Tm 4,8]]From now on the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but to all who have longed for his appearance.\n[[2_Tm 4,17]]But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the proclamation might be completed and all the Gentiles might hear it.
