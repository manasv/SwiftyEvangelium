The rich man also died and was buried,\n[[Lc 16,23]]and from the netherworld, where he was in torment, he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.\n[[Lc 16,24]]And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering torment in these flames.'\n[[Lc 16,25]]Abraham replied, 'My child, remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad; but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented.\n[[Lc 16,26]]Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours or from your side to ours.'\n[[Lc 16,27]]He said, 'Then I beg you, father, send him to my father's house,\n[[Lc 16,28]]for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they too come to this place of torment.'\n[[Lc 16,29]]But Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the prophets.
