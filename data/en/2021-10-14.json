For there is no distinction;\n[[Rm 3,23]]all have sinned and are deprived of the glory of God.\n[[Rm 3,24]]They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus,\n[[Rm 3,25]]whom God set forth as an expiation, through faith, by his blood, to prove his righteousness because of the forgiveness of sins previously committed,\n[[Rm 3,26]]through the forbearance of God--to prove his righteousness in the present time, that he might be righteous and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.\n[[Rm 3,27]]What occasion is there then for boasting? It is ruled out. On what principle, that of works? No, rather on the principle of faith.\n[[Rm 3,28]]For we consider that a person is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\n[[Rm 3,29]]Does God belong to Jews alone? Does he not belong to Gentiles, too? Yes, also to Gentiles,\n[[Rm 3,30]]for God is one and will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised through faith.","type":"reading","title":"Letter to the Romans"},"psalm":{"reference_displayed":"130(129),1-2.3-4b.4c-6.","text":"[[Ps 130,1]]Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD\n[[Ps 130,2]]LORD, hear my voice!\r\nLet your ears be attentive\r\nto my voice in supplication.\n\n[[Ps 130,3]]If you, O LORD, mark iniquities,\r\nLORD, who can stand?\n[[Ps 130,4b]]But with you is forgiveness,\n[[Ps 130,4c]]that you may be revered.\n\n[[Ps 130,5]]I trust in the LORD;\r\nmy soul trusts in his word.\n[[Ps 130,6]]My soul waits for the Lord \r\nmore than sentinels for dawn.","type":"psalm","title":"Psalms"},"gospel":{"reference_displayed":"11,47-54.","text":"[[Lc 11,47]]The Lord said: â€œWoe to you!
