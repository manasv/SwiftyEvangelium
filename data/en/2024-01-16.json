When he entered Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and inquired, \"Is your visit peaceful, O seer?\"\n[[1_S 16,5]]He replied: \"Yes! I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. So cleanse yourselves and join me today for the banquet.\" He also had Jesse and his sons cleanse themselves and invited them to the sacrifice.\n[[1_S 16,6]]As they came, he looked at Eliab and thought, \"Surely the LORD'S anointed is here before him.\"\n[[1_S 16,7]]But the LORD said to Samuel: \"Do not judge from his appearance or from his lofty stature, because I have rejected him. Not as man sees does God see, because man sees the appearance but the LORD looks into the heart.\"\n[[1_S 16,8]]Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him before Samuel, who said, \"The Lord has not chosen him.\"\n[[1_S 16,9]]Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said, \"The LORD has not chosen this one either.\"\n[[1_S 16,10]]In the same way Jesse presented seven sons before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, \"The LORD has not chosen any one of these.\"\n[[1_S 16,11]]Then Samuel asked Jesse, \"Are these all the sons you have?\" Jesse replied, \"There is still the youngest, who is tending the sheep.\" Samuel said to Jesse, \"Send for him; we will not begin the sacrificial banquet until he arrives here.\"\n[[1_S 16,12]]Jesse sent and had the young man brought to them.
