I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg.\n[[Lc 16,4]]I know what I shall do so that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may welcome me into their homes.'\n[[Lc 16,5]]He called in his master's debtors one by one.

Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.'\n[[Lc 16,7]]Then to another he said, 'And you, how much do you owe?' He replied, 'One hundred kors of wheat.'
