For if by that one person's transgression the many died, how much more did the grace of God and the gracious gift of the one person Jesus Christ overflow for the many.\n[[Rm 5,16]]And the gift is not like the result of the one person's sinning. For after one sin there was the judgment that brought condemnation; but the gift, after many transgressions, brought acquittal.\n[[Rm 5,17]]For if, by the transgression of one person, death came to reign through that one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of justification come to reign in life through the one person Jesus Christ.\n[[Rm 5,18]]In conclusion, just as through one transgression condemnation came upon all, so through one righteous act acquittal and life came to all.\n[[Rm 5,19]]For just as through the disobedience of one person the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of one the many will be made righteous.","reference_displayed":"5,12-19.","type":"reading"},"psalm":{"title":"Psalms","reference_displayed":"51(50),3-4.5-6ab.12-13.14.17.","type":"psalm","text":"[[Ps 51,3]]Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; \r\nin the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.\n[[Ps 51,4]]Thoroughly wash me from my guilt \r\nand of my sin cleanse me.\n\n[[Ps 51,5]]For I acknowledge my offense, \r\nand my sin is before me always:\n[[Ps 51,6a]]\"Against you only have I sinned,\n[[Ps 51,6b]]and done what is evil in your sight.\"\n\n[[Ps 51,12]]A clean heart create for me, O God, \r\nand a steadfast spirit renew within me.\n[[Ps 51,13]]Cast me not out from your presence, \r\nand your Holy Spirit take not from me.\n\n[[Ps 51,14]]Give me back the joy of your salvation, \r\nand a willing spirit sustain in me.\n[[Ps 51,17]]O Lord, open my lips, \r\nand my mouth shall proclaim your praise."},"gospel":{"title":"Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew","reference_displayed":"4,1-11.","text":"[[Mt 4,1]]At that time Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.\n[[Mt 4,2]]He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was hungry.\n[[Mt 4,3]]The tempter approached and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread.\"\n[[Mt 4,4]]He said in reply, \"It is written: 'One does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.'\"\n[[Mt 4,5]]Then the devil took him to the holy city, and made him stand on the parapet of the temple,\n[[Mt 4,6]]and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down.
