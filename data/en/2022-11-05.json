In every circumstance and in all things I have learned the secret of being well fed and of going hungry, of living in abundance and of being in need.\n[[Ph 4,13]]I have the strength for everything through him who empowers me.\n[[Ph 4,14]]Still, it was kind of you to share in my distress.\n[[Ph 4,15]]You Philippians indeed know that at the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, not a single church shared with me in an account of giving and receiving, except you alone.\n[[Ph 4,16]]For even when I was at Thessalonica you sent me something for my needs, not only once but more than once.\n[[Ph 4,17]]It is not that I am eager for the gift; rather, I am eager for the profit that accrues to your account.\n[[Ph 4,18]]I have received full payment and I abound.
