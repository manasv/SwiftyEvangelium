There are some who have been so used to idolatry up until now that, when they eat meat sacrificed to idols, their conscience, which is weak, is defiled.\n[[1_Co 8,11]]Thus through your knowledge, the weak person is brought to destruction, the brother for whom Christ died.\n[[1_Co 8,12]]When you sin in this way against your brothers and wound their consciences, weak as they are, you are sinning against Christ.\n[[1_Co 8,13]]Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother to sin."},"psalm":{"type":"psalm","reference_displayed":"139(138),1-3.13-14ab.23-24.","title":"Psalms","text":"[[Ps 139,1]]O LORD, you have probed me and you know me;\n[[Ps 139,2]]you know when I sit and when I stand; \r\nyou understand my thoughts from afar.\n[[Ps 139,3]]My journeys and my rest you scrutinize, \r\nwith all my ways you are familiar.\n\n[[Ps 139,13]]Truly you have formed my inmost being; \r\nyou knit me in my mother's womb.\n[[Ps 139,14a]]I give you thanks that I am fearfully, wonderfully made;\n[[Ps 139,14b]]wonderful are your works.\n\n[[Ps 139,23]]Probe me, O God, and know my heart; \r\ntry me, and know my thoughts;\n[[Ps 139,24]]See if my way is crooked, \r\nand lead me in the way of old."},"gospel":{"type":"gospel","reference_displayed":"6,27-38.","title":"Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke","text":"[[Lc 6,27]]Jesus said to his disciples : \"To you who hear I say, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,\n[[Lc 6,28]]bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.\n[[Lc 6,29]]To the person who strikes you on one cheek, offer the other one as well, and from the person who takes your cloak, do not withhold even your tunic.\n[[Lc 6,30]]Give to everyone who asks of you, and from the one who takes what is yours do not demand it back.\n[[Lc 6,31]]Do to others as you would have them do to you.\n[[Lc 6,32]]For if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
