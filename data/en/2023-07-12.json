When Joseph's brothers came and knelt down before him with their faces to the ground,\n[[Gn 42,7a]]he recognized them as soon as he saw them. But he concealed his own identity from them and spoke sternly to them. \"Where do you come from?\" he asked them. They answered, \"From the land of Canaan, to procure food.\"\n[[Gn 42,17]]With that, he locked them up in the guardhouse for three days.\n[[Gn 42,18]]On the third day Joseph said to them: \"Do this, and you shall live; for I am a God-fearing man.\n[[Gn 42,19]]If you have been honest, only one of your brothers need be confined in this prison, while the rest of you may go and take home provisions for your starving families.\n[[Gn 42,20]]But you must come back to me with your youngest brother. Your words will thus be verified, and you will not die.\" To this they agreed.\n[[Gn 42,21]]To one another, however, they said: \"Alas, we are being punished because of our brother. We saw the anguish of his heart when he pleaded with us, yet we paid no heed; that is why this anguish has now come upon us.\"\n[[Gn 42,22]]\"Didn't I tell you,\" broke in Reuben, \"not to do wrong to the boy? But you wouldn't listen!
