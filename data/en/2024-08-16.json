Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate.\"\n[[Mt 19,7]]They said to him, \"Then why did Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss (her)?\"\n[[Mt 19,8]]He said to them, \"Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.\n[[Mt 19,9]]I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.\"\n[[Mt 19,10]](His) disciples said to him, \"If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.\"\n[[Mt 19,11]]He answered, \"Not all can accept (this) word, but only those to whom that is granted.\n[[Mt 19,12]]Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

Rather, you were thrown out on the ground as something loathsome, the day you were born.\n[[Ez 16,6]]Then I passed by and saw you weltering in your blood. I said to you: Live in your blood\n[[Ez 16,7]]and grow like a plant in the field. You grew and developed, you came to the age of puberty; your breasts were formed, your hair had grown, but you were still stark naked.\n[[Ez 16,8]]Again I passed by you and saw that you were now old enough for love. So I spread the corner of my cloak over you to cover your nakedness; I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you; you became mine, says the Lord GOD.\n[[Ez 16,9]]Then I bathed you with water, washed away your blood, and anointed you with oil.\n[[Ez 16,10]]I clothed you with an embroidered gown, put sandals of fine leather on your feet; I gave you a fine linen sash and silk robes to wear.\n[[Ez 16,11]]I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms, a necklace about your neck,\n[[Ez 16,12]]a ring in your nose, pendants in your ears, and a glorious diadem upon your head.\n[[Ez 16,13]]Thus you were adorned with gold and silver; your garments were of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth.
