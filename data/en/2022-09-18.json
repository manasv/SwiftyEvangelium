{"gospel":{"title":"Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke","text":"[[Lc 16,1]]Jesus said to his disciples, \"A rich man had a steward who was reported to him for squandering his property.\n[[Lc 16,2]]He summoned him and said, 'What is this I hear about you? Prepare a full account of your stewardship, because you can no longer be my steward.'\n[[Lc 16,3]]The steward said to himself, 'What shall I do, now that my master is taking the position of steward away from me? I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg.\n[[Lc 16,4]]I know what I shall do so that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may welcome me into their homes.'\n[[Lc 16,5]]He called in his master's debtors one by one. To the first he said, 'How much do you owe my master?'\n[[Lc 16,6]]He replied, 'One hundred measures of olive oil.' He said to him, 'Here is your promissory note. Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.'\n[[Lc 16,7]]Then to another he said, 'And you, how much do you owe?' He replied, 'One hundred kors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Here is your promissory note; write one for eighty.'\n[[Lc 16,8]]And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently. \"For the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.\"\n[[Lc 16,9]]I tell you, make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth, so that when it fails, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.\n[[Lc 16,10]]The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones; and the person who is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in great ones.\n[[Lc 16,11]]If, therefore, you are not trustworthy with dishonest wealth, who will trust you with true wealth?\n[[Lc 16,12]]If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you what is yours?\n[[Lc 16,13]]No servant can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\"","type":"gospel","reference_displayed":"16,1-13."},"second_reading":{"title":"First Letter to Timothy","text":"[[1_Tm 2,1]]Beloved : First of all, I ask that supplications, prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings be offered for everyone,\n[[1_Tm 2,2]]for kings and for all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all devotion and dignity.\n[[1_Tm 2,3]]This is good and pleasing to God our savior,\n[[1_Tm 2,4]]who wills everyone to be saved and to come to knowledge of the truth.\n[[1_Tm 2,5]]For there is one God.
