It is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: for Jew first, and then Greek.\n[[Rm 1,17]]For in it is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith; as it is written, \"The one who is righteous by faith will live.\"\n[[Rm 1,18]]The wrath of God is indeed being revealed from heaven against every impiety and wickedness of those who suppress the truth by their wickedness.\n[[Rm 1,19]]For what can be known about God is evident to them, because God made it evident to them.\n[[Rm 1,20]]Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes of eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and perceived in what he has made. As a result, they have no excuse;\n[[Rm 1,21]]for although they knew God they did not accord him glory as God or give him thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened.\n[[Rm 1,22]]While claiming to be wise, they became fools\n[[Rm 1,23]]and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for the likeness of an image of mortal man or of birds or of four-legged animals or of snakes.\n[[Rm 1,24]]Therefore, God handed them over to impurity through the lusts of their hearts for the mutual degradation of their bodies.\n[[Rm 1,25]]They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and revered and worshiped the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.","type":"reading","title":"Letter to the Romans"},"psalm":{"reference_displayed":"19(18),2-3.4-5.","text":"[[Ps 19,2]]The heavens declare the glory of God; \r\nand the firmament proclaims his handiwork.\n[[Ps 19,3]]Day pours out the word to day, \r\nand night to night imparts knowledge.\n\n[[Ps 19,4]]Not a word nor a discourse \r\nwhose voice is not heard;\n[[Ps 19,5]]Through all the earth their voice resounds, \r\nand to the ends of the world, their message.","type":"psalm","title":"Psalms"},"gospel":{"reference_displayed":"11,37-41.","text":"[[Lc 11,37]]After Jesus had spoken, a Pharisee invited him to dine at his home.
