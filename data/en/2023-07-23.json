Where have the weeds come from?'\n[[Mt 13,28]]He answered, 'An enemy has done this.' His slaves said to him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'\n[[Mt 13,29]]He replied, 'No, if you pull up the weeds you might uproot the wheat along with them.\n[[Mt 13,30]]Let them grow together until harvest; then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters, \"First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning; but gather the wheat into my barn.\"'\"\n[[Mt 13,31]]He proposed another parable to them. \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a person took and sowed in a field.\n[[Mt 13,32]]It is the smallest of all the seeds, yet when full-grown it is the largest of plants. It becomes a large bush, and the 'birds of the sky come and dwell in its branches.'\"\n[[Mt 13,33]]He spoke to them another parable. \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.\"\n[[Mt 13,34]]All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables. He spoke to them only in parables,\n[[Mt 13,35]]to fulfill what had been said through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will announce what has lain hidden from the foundation of the world.\"\n[[Mt 13,36]]Then, dismissing the crowds, he went into the house. His disciples approached him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\"\n[[Mt 13,37]]He said in reply, \"He who sows good seed is the Son of Man,\n[[Mt 13,38]]the field is the world, the good seed the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the children of the evil one,\n[[Mt 13,39]]and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.\n[[Mt 13,40]]Just as weeds are collected and burned (up) with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.\n[[Mt 13,41]]The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will collect out of his kingdom all who cause others to sin and all evildoers.\n[[Mt 13,42]]They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.\n[[Mt 13,43]]Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
