(And) he went out again around noon, and around three o'clock, and did likewise.\n[[Mt 20,6]]Going out about five o'clock, he found others standing around, and said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'\n[[Mt 20,7]]They answered, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard.'\n[[Mt 20,8]]When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Summon the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and ending with the first.'\n[[Mt 20,9]]When those who had started about five o'clock came, each received the usual daily wage.\n[[Mt 20,10]]So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, but each of them also got the usual wage.\n[[Mt 20,11]]And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner,\n[[Mt 20,12]]saying, 'These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who bore the day's burden and the heat.'\n[[Mt 20,13]]He said to one of them in reply, 'My friend, I am not cheating you. Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?\n[[Mt 20,14]]Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the same as you?\n[[Mt 20,15]](Or) am I not free to do as I wish with my own money? Are you envious because I am generous?'\n[[Mt 20,16a]]Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last.\"","type":"gospel","title":"Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew"},"psalm":{"reference_displayed":"23(22),1-3a.3b-4.5.6.","type":"psalm","title":"Psalms","text":"[[Ps 23,1]]The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n[[Ps 23,2]]In verdant pastures he gives me repose; \r\nbeside restful waters he leads me;\n[[Ps 23,3a]]he refreshes my soul.Â \n\n[[Ps 23,3b]]He guides me in right paths\r\nfor His names's sake.\n[[Ps 23,4]]Even though I walk in the dark valley \r\nI fear no evil; for you are at my side \r\nwith your rod and your staff \r\nthat give me courage.\n\n[[Ps 23,5]]You spread the table before me \r\nin the sight of my foes; \r\nYou anoint my head with oil; \r\nmy cup overflows.\n\n[[Ps 23,6]]Only goodness and kindness follow me \r\nall the days of my life; \r\nand I shall dwell in the house of the LORD \r\nfor years to come."},"first_reading":{"reference_displayed":"34,1-11.","text":"[[Ez 34,1]]Thus the word of the LORD came to me:\n[[Ez 34,2]]Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, in these words prophesy to them (to the shepherds): Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been pasturing themselves!
