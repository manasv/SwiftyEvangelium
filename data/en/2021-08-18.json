He said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard.'\n[[Mt 20,8]]When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Summon the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and ending with the first.'\n[[Mt 20,9]]When those who had started about five o'clock came, each received the usual daily wage.\n[[Mt 20,10]]So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, but each of them also got the usual wage.\n[[Mt 20,11]]And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner,\n[[Mt 20,12]]saying, 'These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who bore the day's burden and the heat.'\n[[Mt 20,13]]He said to one of them in reply, 'My friend, I am not cheating you.
