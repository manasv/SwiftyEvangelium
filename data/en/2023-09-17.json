Instead, he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt.\n[[Mt 18,31]]Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master and reported the whole affair.\n[[Mt 18,32]]His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.\n[[Mt 18,33]]Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?'\n[[Mt 18,34]]Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt.\n[[Mt 18,35]]So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.\""},"date":"2023-09-17","first_reading":{"reference_displayed":"27,30.28,1-7.","title":"Book of Sirach","type":"reading","text":"[[Si 27,30]]Wrath and anger are hateful things, yet the sinner hugs them tight.\n[[Si 28,1]]The vengeful will suffer the LORD'S vengeance, for he remembers their sins in detail.\n[[Si 28,2]]Forgive your neighbor's injustice; then when you pray, your own sins will be forgiven.\n[[Si 28,3]]Should a man nourish anger against his fellows and expect healing from the LORD?\n[[Si 28,4]]Should a man refuse mercy to his fellows, yet seek pardon for his own sins?\n[[Si 28,5]]If he who is but flesh cherishes wrath, who will forgive his sins?\n[[Si 28,6]]Remember your last days, set enmity aside; remember death and decay, and cease from sin!\n[[Si 28,7]]Think of the commandments, hate not your neighbor; of the Most High's covenant, and overlook faults."},"second_reading":{"reference_displayed":"14,7-9.","title":"Letter to the Romans","text":"[[Rm 14,7]]Brothers and sisters: None of us lives for oneself, and no one dies for oneself.\n[[Rm 14,8]]For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord; so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.\n[[Rm 14,9]]For this is why Christ died and came to life, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.","type":"reading"},"psalm":{"reference_displayed":"103(102),1-2.3-4.9-10.11-12.","type":"psalm","text":"[[Ps 103,1]]Bless the LORD, O my soul; \r\nand all my being, bless his holy name.\n[[Ps 103,2]]Bless the LORD, O my soul, \r\nand forget not all his benefits.\n\n[[Ps 103,3]]He pardons all your iniquities, \r\nhe heals all your ills.\n[[Ps 103,4]]He redeems your life from destruction, \r\nhe crowns you with kindness and compassion.\n\n[[Ps 103,9]]He will not always chide, \r\nnor does he keep his wrath forever.\n[[Ps 103,10]]Not according to our sins does he deal with us, \r\nnor does he requite us according to our crimes.\n\n[[Ps 103,11]]For as the heavens are high above the earth, \r\nso surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.\n[[Ps 103,12]]As far as the east is from the west, \r\nso far has he put our transgressions from us.","title":"Psalms"}}
